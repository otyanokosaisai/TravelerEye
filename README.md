## GenAIonRTX Contest Appeal

We are thrilled to present **TravelerEye** as our submission to the **Nvidia GenAIonRTX contest (2024) Text-Based Applications**. Our project harnesses the synergistic powers of BLIP-2 and Llama2-7b models, traditionally known for their intensive computational demands. With the integration of TensorRT-llm, we've achieved a monumental leap in performance, accelerating processing speeds by several folds. This breakthrough enables TravelerEye to extract meaningful insights from mere images, transforming them into rich narratives and interactive experiences.

### Problem Statement and Vision

In an era where social media proliferation has inadvertently contributed to the superficiality of family connections, TravelerEye aims to counteract this trend by deepening the shared experiences of past travels. Our application doesn't just recall memories; it reignites conversations, fosters shared joy, and strengthens bonds through the vivid storytelling of your journeys.

Moreover, TravelerEye addresses the common challenge faced during solo travels or trips without a guide. It empowers travelers to uncover the stories behind their surroundings and captured moments, solely based on their photographs. This feature not only enhances the travel experience but also serves as a virtual companion, providing context and insights that might otherwise require extensive research or a human guide.

### Enhancing Communication through Shared Photo Experiences

TravelerEye also innovates in the realm of social interactions, particularly in photo sharing among friends. By appending information derived from images, our application enriches conversations, adding layers of context and intrigue that facilitate smoother, more engaging communication. This feature is especially valuable in today's digital age, where meaningful interaction is often lost amidst the noise of constant content sharing.

### Conclusion

Our submission to the Nvidia GenAIonRTX contest is more than just an application; it's a tool designed to bridge gaps, create connections, and enhance the way we interact with our memories and the world around us. Powered by the cutting-edge acceleration of TensorRT-llm, TravelerEye stands at the forefront of AI-driven innovation, promising to revolutionize the way we perceive, share, and converse about our travel experiences.

We believe that TravelerEye not only showcases the potential of combining powerful AI models with advanced acceleration technologies but also addresses pressing social issues, making it a worthy contender in the GenAIonRTX contest. Our hope is that this platform will inspire more meaningful interactions, bring people closer, and make every travel memory a treasure worth sharing.
